![Setup](.Readme/UVS_Setup.gif)

*Note: All prefabs are in the `Packages` folder so make sure that you select either `All` or `Packages` when searching for them.*

1. Add `TLP_Essentials` prefab to your scene
2. Add `TLP_SyncOrigin` prefab to your scene and verify it is not rotated and at position 0,0,0
3. Add any vehicle prefab to your scene
4. Drag and drop the `TLP_UdonVehicleSync_with_SettingsTweaker_SaccFlightAdapter` onto the vehicle prefab.
5. Open the prefab and adjust the position of the `SettingsTweaker` menu to be easily usable (disable GameObject if not needed).
6. Enter play mode with client sim enabled and verify that there is no related errors on the console.
7. Upload or test with multiple clients to see it in action.

## Known Issues
